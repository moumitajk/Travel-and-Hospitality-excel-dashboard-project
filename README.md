#  Sky Analytics: Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of flight, airline, and airport data aimed at understanding operational efficiency, delays, cancellations, and traffic volume in the aviation industry. Conducted as a group project with 6 members, the study uses Excel for data cleaning, pivot-based analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.

---

## Datasets Used

- **flights.csv** – Detailed flight information including delays, times, and distances.
- **airlines.csv** – Airline codes and names.
- **airports.csv** – Airport codes, locations, and coordinates.

---

## Objectives

- Identify patterns in flight delays and cancellations.
- Analyze airline performance and airport connectivity.
- Evaluate long-haul vs. short-haul operations.
- Build a fully interactive Excel dashboard with slicers, charts, and metrics.

## Key Analyses Performed

1. **Missing Data Handling** – Identified patterns in missing data linked to cancelled/diverted flights.
2. **Flight Delays** – Calculated average delay by airline and highlighted worst-performing carriers.
3. **Airport Traffic Volume** – Identified top 5 busiest airports based on flight volume.
4. **Cancellations** – Analyzed airline-wise cancellation rates and common reasons.
5. **Seasonal and Day-based Trends** – Explored how delays and cancellations vary over time.
6. **Fleet Utilization** – Assessed flight counts per aircraft using tail numbers.
7. **Geographical Analysis** – Plotted airport locations using latitude and longitude.
8. **Long-Haul vs Short-Haul Comparison** – Compared delay and cancellation metrics by distance category.

## Dashboard Features

- Summary of total flights, average delays, and cancellations.
- Airline and airport performance visualizations.
- Delay cause breakdown via stacked bar charts.
- Time-based and seasonal trends with interactive filters.
- Geographical airport mapping using scatter plots.
